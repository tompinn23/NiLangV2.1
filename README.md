# Nilang Compiler V2.1
Not really v2 just internal versioning.

This is the repository for the NiLang Compiler.  
Before we dig in here are some handy repository to check out:
* [Nilang Specification](https://github.com/tompinn23/NI-Spec) Still not fully fleshed out, writing it is boring
* [Nilang V1](https://github.com/tompinn23/NiLang) OG NiLang Compiler built in C# and pretty poor imo.
* [Nilang Standard Library](https://github.com/tompinn23/NiLang-Standard-Library) So thats the standard library its pretty thin 

## Introduction

Right so here we are and you wanna build NiLang well ngl it kinda takes the piss and is only tested on Windows 7/ 10 Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition 64bit.

### Dependencies
* LLVM 5.0.0
* Bison 3.0.4+
* Flex 2.6.3+

##### Windows

To obtain LLVM 5.0.0 go [here](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStartedVS.html) and follow said guide.  
To obtain flex and bison I recommend installing chocolatey from [here](https://chocolatey.org/install).
Then run ```choco install winflexbison3```
